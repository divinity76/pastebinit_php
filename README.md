# pastebinit_php
php script to upload stuff to pastebin websites - inspired by StÃ©phane Graber's pastebinit

as of writing, it only works with Fedora's pastebin ( http://paste.fedoraproject.org/ ), takes everything in stdin, and upload it, takes NO arguments, and uploads with settings 
```php
[
'paste_lang'=>'text',
'mode'=>'json',
'private_paste'=>'yes',
'paste_expire' => 1 * 60 * 60 * 24 * 365
]
```
(past_expire means 1 year), and returns the wget friendly URL.

example install

```bash
su
wget -O /usr/bin/pastebinit.php https://raw.githubusercontent.com/divinity76/pastebinit_php/master/pastebinit.php
chmod +x /usr/bin/pastebinit.php
ln -s /usr/bin/pastebinit.php /usr/bin/pastebinit
exit
```
